# donate

pastemyst is completely free and open source. it has no ads or premium features. because of this pastemyst by itself doesn't make any money, and unfortunately hosting a website like this costs money.

if you like pastemyst and want to support my work you can donate some money, any amount matters a lot!

here are some places you can support me on:

- [liberapay/codemyst](https://liberapay.com/codemyst)
- [patreon/codemyst](https://www.patreon.com/codemyst)
- [ko-fi/codemyst](https://ko-fi.com/codemyst)

if you donate to pastemyst you will get a special supporter badge on your profile for everyone to see. when you donate please email me (contact email can be found at the bottom of the page) with an image confirming your donation.

even if you can't support my work financially, i really appreciate everyone who does use pastemyst as that means that my work didn't go to waste as there are people using it!
